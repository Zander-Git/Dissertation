Research question: Evaulation of various techniques, and execution times, of different filtering systems (including correlation)

Lit Review: Basics of dsp (high level overview), why filtering, various filtering techniques (FIR vs IIR), various fir filters

Res Meth: Experimental, get signal from public repository, apply filter, convolution,, analyse results,

Results: performance, excectution time, trade off

Conclusion:

matching part is easy, filtering is the nuts 

filter 1, filter 2, filter 3
